It is our honour to have been awarded by [OpenUK for the 2023 Award](https://openuk.uk/awards/) in the Software category! The award ceremony was a very memorable experience.

In case you wonder, SeaQL was founded in Hong Kong, and is based in the United Kingdom since 2023. Within this year, we released SeaStreamer, two major versions of SeaORM, a new version of Seaography, and have been busy working on a new project on the side.

We reached the milestone of 5k GitHub stars and 2M crates.io downloads mid-year.

In the summer, we took in two interns for our 3rd summer of code.

We plan to offer internships tailored to UK students in 2024 through university internship programs. As always, we welcome contributors from all over the world, and may be we will enrol on GSoC 2024 again. (but open-source is not bounded any schedule, so you can start contributing anytime)

A big thanks to our sponsors who continued to support us, and we look forward to a more impactful 2024.
