import * as Chart from '../src/chart.js';

524 members of the SeaQL community from 41 countries kindly contributed their thoughts on using SeaQL libraries, learning Rust and employing Rust in their day to day development lives. From these responses we hope to get an understanding of where SeaQL and Rust stands in 2023.

This is our first community survey, we will conduct the survey annually to keep track of how the community evolves over time.

## Share Your Thoughts

#### 32. Anything else you want to say or let us know?

> Good job yall

> Great projects, thanks for your hard work

> I expect it to be an asynchronous type-safe library. Keep up the good work!

> I'd like to see entity generation without a database

> The website, support from JetBrains, the documentation and the release cycle are very nice!

> I'm very interested in how SeaORM will continue evolving and I would like to wish you the best of luck!

> I've found SeaORM very useful and I'm very grateful to the development team for creating and maintaining it!

> In TypeORM I can write entities and then generate migration from them. It's very handy. It helps to increase development speed. It would be nice to have this functionality in SeaORM.

> It needs to have better integration with SeaQuery, I sometimes need to get to it because not all features are available in SeaORM which makes it a pain.

> Keep the good work!

> Keep going! Love SeaORM!

> Keep up the great work. Rust needs a fast, ergonomic and reliable ORM.

> SeaORM is very powerful, but the rust docs and tutorial examples could be more fleshed out.

> SeaORM is an awesome library. Most things are quite concise and therefore straightforward. Simply a few edge cases concerning DB specific types and values could be better.

> Automatic migration generation would make the library pretty much perfect in my opinion.

> SeaQL tutorials could be better. Much more detailed explanation and definitely it has to have best practices section for Design Patterns like and good best practices related with clean architecture.

> SeqQL are great products and it’s very enjoyable using them

> Thank you <3

> Thank you for awesome library!

> Thank you for this wonderful project. I feel the documentation lacks examples for small functions and usage of some obscure features.

> Thank you for your hard work!

> Thank you for your work on SeaQL, your efforts are appreciated 

> Thank you for your work, we are seeking actively to include seaorm un our projects

> Thank you very much for your work!

> Thank you!! Such a good group of libraries.

> Thanks a lot for the amazing work you guys put into this set of libraries. This is an amazing development for the rust ecosystem.

> Thanks and keep up the good work.

> Thanks for a great tool!

> Thanks for all the amazing work yall do.

> Thanks for making SeaORM!

> thanks for your greet work

> The project I am doing for work is only a prototype, it's a new implementation of a current Python forecasting project which uses a pandas and a custom psycopg2 orm. My intent is to create a faster/dev friendly version with SeaOrm and Polars. I am hoping to eventually get a prototype I can display to my team to get a go ahead to fully develop a new version, and to migrate 4-5 other forecasting apps using shared libraries for io and calculations.

> I have also been using SeaOrm for a small api client for financial data, which I may make opensource.

> I think one thing which could really improve SeaOrm is some more advance examples in the documentation section. The docs are really detailed as far as rust documentation goes.

> The trait system is too complex and coding experience is not pretty well with that.

> Very promising project, keep it up.

> Y'all are nice, and SeaORM needs better dev experience, but I gues it's managable.

> Thank you so much for taking it upon yourselves to selflessly give your free time. It probably doesn't matter much, but thank you so much for your work. SeaORM is a fantastic tool that I can see myself using for a long time to come. I hope to make contributions in any form when I am under better circumstances :3 Kudos to the team!

> 你们的库非常的棒，至少我觉得比Diesel好太多了，入门简单，对新手非常友好，这是最大的亮点，其次是库貌似可以实现很复杂的Join SQL逻辑而不用写原生的SQL，这点也是非常值得点赞的，但是在这块的文档貌似写的有点简略了，希望可以丰富一下文档内容，对于复杂查询的说明可以更加详细一些，这样就再好不过了。谢谢你们，我会持续关注你们，未来的项目如果涉及ORM，那绝对非你们莫属了！
